			<p>For haste, for unadulterated despatch, commend me to the county burying. The body politic is busy and has no time to waste on an inert human body. It does its duty to its own interest and to the pauper dead when the body is dropped with all celerity into the ground. The county is philosophical: it says, “Poor devil, the world was unkind to him: he’ll be glad to get out of it: we’ll be doing him a favour to put him at the earliest moment out of sight and sound and feeling of the things that wounded him. Then, too, the quicker the cheaper, and that will make it easier on the taxpayers.” This latter is so comforting! So the order is written, the funeral is rushed through, and the county goes home to its dinner, feeling well satisfied with itself⁠—so potent are the consolations of philosophy at so many hundreds per year.</p>
			<p>To this general order poor Margaret’s funeral proved no exception. The morning after her decease she was shrouded and laid in her cheap pine coffin to await those last services which, in a provincial town, are the meed of saint and sinner alike. The room in which she lay was very clean⁠—unnaturally so⁠—from the attention of Miss Prime. Clean muslin curtains had been put up at the windows, and the one cracked mirror which the house possessed had been covered with white cloth. The lace-like carpet had been taken off the floor, and the boards had been scrubbed white. The little stove in the corner, now cold, was no longer red with rust. In a tumbler on a little table at Margaret’s head stood the only floral offering that gave a touch of tenderness to the grim scene⁠—a bunch of homegrown scarlet and white geraniums. Some woman had robbed her wintered room of this bit of brightness for the memory of the dead. The perfume of the flowers mingled heavily with the faint odour which pervades the chamber of death⁠—an odour that is like the reminiscence of sorrow.</p>
			<p>Like a spirit of order, with solemn face and quiet tread, Miss Hester moved about the room, placing one thing here, another there, but ever doing or changing something, all with maidenly neatness. What a childish fancy this is of humanity’s, tiptoeing and whispering in the presence of death, as if one by an incautious word or a hasty step might wake the sleeper from such deep repose!</p>
			<p>The service had been set for two o’clock in the afternoon. One or two women had already come in to “sit,” but by half-past one the general congregation began to arrive and to take their places. They were mostly women. The hour of the day was partially responsible for this; but then men do not go to funerals anyway, if they can help it. They do not revel, like their sisters, in the exquisite pleasure of sorrow. Most of the women had known pain and loss themselves, and came with ready sympathy, willing, nay, anxious to be moved to tears. Some of them came dragging by one hand children, dressed stiffly, uncomfortably, and ludicrously⁠—a medley of soiled ribbons, big collars, wide bows, and very short knickerbockers. The youngsters were mostly curious and ill-mannered, and ever and anon one had to be slapped by its mother into snivelling decorum. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Davis came in with one of her own children and leading the dead woman’s boy by the hand. At this a buzz of whispered conversation began.</p>
			<p>“Pore little dear,” said one, as she settled the bow more securely under her own boy’s sailor collar⁠—“pore little dear, he’s all alone in the world.”</p>
			<p>“I never did see in all my life sich a young child look so sad,” said another.</p>
			<p>“H’m!” put in a third; “in this world pore motherless childern has plenty o’ reason to look sad, I tell you.”</p>
			<p>She brushed the tears off the cheek of her little son whom she had slapped a moment before. She was tender now.</p>
			<p>One woman bent down and whispered into her child’s ear as she pointed with one cotton-gloved finger, “See, Johnny, see little Freddie, there; he ain’t got no mother no more. Pore little Freddie! ain’t you sorry fur him?” The child nodded, and gazed with open-eyed wonder at “little Freddie” as if he were of a new species.</p>
			<p>The curtains, stirred by the blast through the loose windows, flapped dismally, and the people drew their wraps about them, for the fireless room was cold. Steadily, insistently, the hive-like drone of conversation murmured on.</p>
			<p>“I wonder who’s a-goin’ to preach the funeral,” asked one.</p>
			<p>“Oh, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Simpson, of the Methodist Church, of course: she used to go to that church years ago, you know, before she backslid.”</p>
			<p>“That’s jest what I’ve allus said about people that falls from grace. You know the last state o’ that man is worse than the first.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, that’s true enough.”</p>
			<p>“It’s a-puttin’ yore hand to the ploughshare an’ then turnin’ back.”</p>
			<p>“I wonder what the preacher’ll have to say fur her. It’s a mighty hard case to preach about.”</p>
			<p>“I’m wonderin’ too what he’ll say, an’ where he’ll preach her.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it’s hard to tell. You know the Methodists believe that there’s ‘salvation to be found between the stirrup an’ the ground.’ ”</p>
			<p>“It’s a mighty comfortin’ doctern, too.”</p>
			<p>“An’ then they do say that she left some dyin’ testimony; though I ain’t never heerd tell the straight of it.”</p>
			<p>“He can’t preach her into heaven, o’ course, after her life. Leastways it don’t hardly seem like it would be right an’ proper.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I don’t think he kin preach her into hell, neither. After a woman has gone through all that pore Margar’t has, it seems to me that the Lord ought to give her some consideration, even if men don’t.”</p>
			<p>“I do declare, Seely Matthews, with yore free thinkin’ an’ free speakin’, you’re put’ nigh a infidel.”</p>
			<p>“No, I ain’t no infidel, neither, but I ain’t one o’ them that sings, ‘When all thy mercies, O my God,’ and thinks o’ the Lord as if He was a great big cruel man.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I don’t neither; but⁠—”</p>
			<p>“ ’Sh! ’sh!”</p>
			<p>The woman’s declaration of principle was cut short by the entrance of the minister, the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Simpson. He was a tall, gaunt man, in a coat of rusty black. His hair, of an indeterminate colour, was slightly mixed with grey. A pair of bright grey eyes looked out from underneath bushy eyebrows. His lips were close set. His bony hands were large and ungainly. The <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Simpson had been a carpenter before he was “called.” He went immediately to the stand where lay the Bible and hymnbook. He was followed by a man who had entered with him⁠—a man with soft eyes and a kindly face. He was as tall as the pastor, and slender, but without the other’s gauntness. He was evidently a church official of some standing.</p>
			<p>With strange inappropriateness, the preacher selected and gave out the hymn:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:hymn">
				<p>
					<span>Sister, thou wast mild and lovely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gentle as the summer’s breeze.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>With some misgivings, it was carried through in the wavering treble of the women and the straggling bass of the few men: then the kindly-faced man, whom the preacher addressed as “Brother Hodges,” knelt and offered prayer. The supplication was very tender and childlike. Even by the light of faith he did not seek to penetrate the veil of divine intention, nor did he throw his javelin of prayer straight against the Deity’s armour of eternal reserve. He left all to God, as a child lays its burden at its father’s feet, and many eyes were moist as the people rose from their knees.</p>
			<p>The sermon was a noisy and rather inconsequential effort. The preacher had little to say, but he roared that little out in a harsh, unmusical voice accompanied by much slapping of his hands and pounding of the table. Towards the end he lowered his voice and began to play upon the feelings of his willing hearers, and when he had won his meed of sobs and tears, when he had sufficiently probed old wounds and made them bleed afresh, when he had conjured up dead sorrows from the grave, when he had obscured the sun of heavenly hope with the vapours of earthly grief, he sat down, satisfied.</p>
			<p>The people went forward, some curiously, some with sympathy, to look their last on the miserable dead. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Davis led the weeping child forward and held him up for a last gaze on his mother’s face. The poor geraniums were wiped and laid by the dead hands, and then the undertaker glided in like a stealthy, black-garmented ghost. He screwed the pine-top down, and the coffin was borne out to the hearse. He clucked to his horses, and, with Brother Hodges and the preacher in front, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Davis, Miss Prime, and the motherless boy behind, the little funeral train moved down the street towards the graveyard, a common but pathetic spectacle.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren had remained behind to attend to the house. She watched the short procession out of sight. “I guess Margar’t didn’t have no linen worth havin’,” she said to herself, “but I’ll jest look.” And look she did, but without success. In disappointment and disgust she went out and took the streamer of dusty black and dingy white crape from the door where it had fluttered, and, bringing it in, laid it on the empty trestles, that the undertaker might find it when he came for them. She took the cloth off the mirror, and then, with one searching look around to see that she had missed nothing worth taking, she went out, closing and locking the door behind her.</p>
			<p>“I guess I’m as much entitled to anything Mag had as anyone else,” said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Warren.</p>
